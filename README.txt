NameName
+++++++++++++++++++++++

A simple custom CiviCRM search to find contacts that have the same first
and last name (often these contacts are spam and can be purged.)

How to use
----------
Install by cloning to your CiviCRM extensions directory and then enabling
as usual for CiviCRM extensions. This will create a new search under
"civicrm/contact/search/custom/list?reset=1" called "NameName".

Click on "NameName". This should take you to a page titled "Search For
Spam Entries Where First Name = Last Name" which has a search button on
it. Click the Search button.

You will see a list of Individual contacts on your site that have the
same first and last name. Now you can use the Actions menu to do what
you want (group/export/delete/etc.).
